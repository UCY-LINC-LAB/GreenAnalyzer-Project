# Federated Learning Workload and Carbon Intensity Analysis

In these experiments, we deployed a set of Federated Learning (FL) workloads on the aerOS project at the Poland Pilot. During the deployment, we captured key utilization metrics and power consumption data.

### Key Analyses
- **Workload Analysis**: Conducted using the `WorkloadAnalysis.ipynb` notebook, which explores the performance of FL workloads.
- **Energy Consumption & Carbon Emissions**: Analyzed using the `CarbonIntensityAnalysis.ipynb` notebook, which highlights energy usage and carbon emission metrics. These analyses were integral to the project's final deliverable and demonstrated the practical applicability of our framework.

### Statistical Modeling
The `simulation.py` file includes our statistical modeling of multiple FL workloads. These models were developed using data extracted from our FL benchmarking efforts.

### Benchmarking Framework
The benchmarking was conducted using the **FedBed framework**, which can be found here:
